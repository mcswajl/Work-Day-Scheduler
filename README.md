# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

I was provided starter code that linked me to moments library to work with date and time. I ended up editing the html slightly to get my js code to function correctly. My biggest struggle in this challenge was storing my task in local storage so when I refreshed the browser my task would still show up and not be deleted. I still need to edit the col- (in the html) or the CSS to make this application mobile friendly.

The URL of the deployed application is https://mcswajl.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

The URL of the GitHub repository is https://github.com/mcswajl/Work-Day-Scheduler


## Below is the Acceptance Criteria that I was challenged with

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
